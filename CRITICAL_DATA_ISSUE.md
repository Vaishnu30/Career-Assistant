## üö® DATA PERSISTENCE ANALYSIS

### Current Architecture Problems:

#### 1. REGISTRATION DATA FLOW:
```
Registration Form ‚Üí React State ‚Üí NOWHERE PERSISTENT
```
- `handleRegister()` only calls `setProfile()` (React state)
- No localStorage, sessionStorage, or database saving
- User data vanishes on page refresh

#### 2. PROFILE CHANGES:
```
UserProfile Component ‚Üí React State ‚Üí NOWHERE PERSISTENT  
```
- Profile edits only update React state
- "Save Changes" button shows alert but saves nothing
- All work lost on refresh

#### 3. AUTHENTICATION MISMATCH:
```
Mock Auth (localStorage) ‚â† User Registration Data (React state only)
```
- DescopeAuth saves mock user to localStorage
- Registration creates different user data in React state
- No connection between the two systems

### CRITICAL CONSEQUENCES:
- ‚ùå User registers, refreshes page ‚Üí Account "doesn't exist"
- ‚ùå User completes profile, closes browser ‚Üí All work lost  
- ‚ùå User generates resume, comes back later ‚Üí No profile data
- ‚ùå Multiple registrations create no persistent accounts
- ‚ùå Sign-in/Sign-out doesn't preserve user data

### HACKATHON DEMO RISK:
This will fail during live demonstration when:
1. Presenter registers new account
2. Refreshes browser or navigates away
3. User account and profile data disappears
4. Demo breaks, looks unprofessional

### URGENT FIXES NEEDED:
1. Implement localStorage persistence for user accounts
2. Save profile data to localStorage on changes
3. Restore user data on page load
4. Sync authentication with registration data
5. Add data validation and error handling
